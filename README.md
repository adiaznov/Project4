# Soccer Player Position Prediction

## Overview
This project applies a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict soccer player positions based on 2021-2022 season player statistics from Football Reference Data (Top 5 European Leagues).

## Dataset
- Source: Football Reference (2021-2022 Top 5 European Leagues Player Stats)
- Features include minutes played, goals, assists, defensive actions, and more.

## Objective
To predict the `Pos` (player position) using in-game performance metrics.

## Methods
- Data Cleaning with Pandas and Numpy
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Classification using scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier
- Evaluation with accuracy score and classification report
- Visualization of the decision tree and feature importances
